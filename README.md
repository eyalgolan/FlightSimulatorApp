Advanced Programming 2 course, Flight Simulator App
Created by: Yair Hanimov and Eyal Golan
Overview:
In this program  we used the mvvm principle to program the flight simulator desctop app.
We have a convenient user interface for operating a small aircraft.
The aircraft responds to instructions regarding the various control surfaces: Rudder, Elevator, Aileron, Throttle.
And on the other hand get up-to-date metrics such as speed elevation position etc.
On the side of the GUI we have 3 main components
* Recent map showing the location of the aircraft
* Flight joystick and the proud control of the flight components of the aircraft
* A display panel that shows current data and information about the status of the aircraft and flight such as speed, altitude, etc.

All commands are sent via a communication channel over IP / T protocol
